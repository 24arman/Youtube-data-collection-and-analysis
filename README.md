# Youtube-data-collection-and-analysis
In this project, we collect and analyze trending YouTube video data using Python. The tools and libraries we use include googleapiclient.discovery for accessing YouTube's API, pandas for data manipulation, os for file operations, and matplotlib for data visualization. The development environment is Google Colab, which provides an interactive platform for coding and data analysis. we set up and authenticate our connection to the YouTube API using an API key. This step involves installing necessary libraries and configuring the API access in Google Colab. Once authenticated, we use googleapiclient.discovery to connect to the YouTube API and retrieve data for trending videos. The data collected includes video IDs, titles, descriptions, view counts, likes, and comments.The retrieved data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis. Using pandas.to_csv(), we save this DataFrame to a CSV file, ensuring our data is properly stored and can be reloaded for future analysis.Next, we analyze the collected data to identify trends such as the most common categories, average view counts, and like-to-dislike ratios. Pandas is used extensively for data cleaning and preprocessing, which involves handling missing values and converting data types as necessary.For visualization, we employ matplotlib to create bar charts, scatter plots, and other visual representations of our data. These visualizations help us understand the distribution of views, likes, and comments across different video categories. The os module is utilized to manage file operations and ensure our data files are properly handled and stored.
